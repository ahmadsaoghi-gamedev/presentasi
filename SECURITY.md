## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Safe for Public Deployment

This project is designed to be safely deployed to public repositories and
hosting platforms:

- **No API Keys**: All external API integrations have been removed
- **No Sensitive Data**: No personal information or credentials are stored
- **Client-Side Only**: All functionality runs in the browser without server
  dependencies
- **Static Assets**: Only uses public CDN resources (Google Fonts, Material
  Icons)

### üîí Data Privacy

- **No Data Collection**: The application does not collect or store any user
  data
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or tracking scripts are included
- **Local Storage Only**: Any temporary data is stored locally in the browser
- **No Server Communication**: All functionality is self-contained

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated client-side
- **XSS Protection**: Content is properly escaped and sanitized
- **CSP Ready**: Compatible with Content Security Policy headers
- **HTTPS Ready**: All external resources use HTTPS

### üö® Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email the details to: [your-email@example.com]
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow 48 hours for response

### üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Verify no API keys in source code
- [ ] Check all external resources use HTTPS
- [ ] Validate input sanitization
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Review Content Security Policy

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** before processing
4. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
5. **Use HTTPS** for all external resources

### For Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS** for the hosting platform
2. **Set appropriate headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
3. **Monitor for vulnerabilities** in dependencies
4. **Regular security audits** of the codebase
5. **Keep hosting platform updated**

## Dependencies

This project uses only safe, public CDN resources:
